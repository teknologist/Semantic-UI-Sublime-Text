Sublime Text snippets for the [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) framework.

*This package is work in progress*

## Installation

### Package Control

1. Make sure you already have [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/) installed
2. Choose *Install Package* from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on OS X)
3. Select *Semantic UI* and press `Enter`

### GitHub

1. Change to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory
2. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/Semantic-UI-Sublime-Text.git`

### Manual installation

1. Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
2. Unzip the files to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Usage

### Completions
All command completions are prefixed with `ui`, typing dash-connected className names should trigger the element of choice.

Examples:

* `ui-image` completes to an image tag
* `ui-form` will complete to form tags
* `ui-blue-label` completes to a blue label

### Snippets
There are some extra snippets for elements with children. For instance, you can use `ui-4-button` for a button group with four buttons inside.

### Icons

To add icon support, please install [Icon Fonts](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Icon%20Fonts) via Package Control.

## Troubleshooting

By default, command completion should be enabled in all versions of Sublime Text. If the completion pop-up doesn't work, you can use `Ctrl+Space` to force it to show up. Alternatively, you might also have to add the HTML scope (`text.html`) to your user settings under `auto_complete_selector`.
